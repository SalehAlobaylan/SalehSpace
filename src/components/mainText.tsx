                I started this project in 2017 as a first project for me to learn coding
                but i dropped it because i don't know what to put in it 
                <br /><br />
                now after more than 8 years i decided to rebuild the project but still i don't know what to put in it ðŸ˜†
                <br /><br />
                but at the end, i just want a space for me in this internet :)
